        As COVID-19 became an increased risk for diners and restaurant owners, many turned to Uber Eats to limit disease transmission. Uber Eats introduced contactless deliveries, allowing for drivers and consumers to safely resume a slice of
        'normal' life.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Q2 of 2020, Uber Eats had a 103% increase in revenue alone. Q2 began in April at the height of COVID-19 lockdowns across the country.

                var t = document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-" + e) || document.querySelector("iframe[src*='" + e + "']");
                t && (t.style.height = a.data["datawrapper-height"][e] + "px")
              }
          }))
        }();
      </script>

        Marie Tassiello, an Uber Eats courier who has been delivering since 2019, noticed an extreme uptick in deliveries once lockdowns started. "At the beginning of April, my app would not stop going off. I was doing triple the amount of orders on
        my usual route. At first, I thought I was imagining how busy I was, but learning that Uber earned so much this year confirms my suspicion," she said.
      </p>
      <p>
        With Q4 just beginning and lockdown phases rolling back countrywide, Uber Eats revenue increase may continue.
